Cloudflare is a popular choice for hosting static assets, such as images, videos, and documents. It is a cloud-based service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere in the world. This is a great option for storing backups, as it is easy to set up and manage.

1. Create a new bucket and any name you want.
2. Go to initial R2 Screen, and go to `Manager R2 API Tokens` and create a new token.
3. Set a Token Name
4. Set `Object Read & Write` Permission.
5. (Optional) Set Specify bucket, by default it will include all buckets.
6. Create the token.

Now copy the following variables:

- `Access Key` -> `Access Key (Dokploy)` = eg. `f3811c6d27415a9s6cv943b6743ad784`
- `Secret Key` -> `Secret Key (Dokploy)` = eg. `aa55ee40b4049e93b7252bf698408cc22a3c2856d2530s7c1cb7670e318f15e58`
- `Region` -> `Region (Dokploy)` = eg. `WNAM, ENAM, etc` it will depend on the region you are using.
- `Endpoint` -> `Endpoint (Dokploy)` = eg. `https://8ah554705io7842d54c499fbee1156c1c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`
- `Bucket` -> `Bucket (Dokploy)` = eg. `dokploy-backups` use the name of the bucket you created.

Test the connection and you should see a success message.
