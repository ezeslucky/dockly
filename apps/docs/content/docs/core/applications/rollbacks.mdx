Rollbacks are a powerful feature that allows you to easily revert changes to your application. This is particularly useful when you encounter issues or want to revert to a previous version of your application.


## Requirements

1. Have a `/health` endpoint in your application.

## Steps to Rollback


Let's suppose we have a NodeJS application that has a health check route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code and running in the port 3000.

1. In your application is necessary to have a `Path` or `Health Route` to be able to achieve zero downtime deployments eg. in the case of a NodeJS app you can have a route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.
2. Go to `Advanced` Tab and go to Cluster Settings and enter to `Swarm Settings`
3. There are a couple options that you can use, in this case we will focus on `Health Check` and `Update Config`.
4. Paste this code in the health check field:
Make sure the API Route exists in your application

```json
{
  "Test": [
    "CMD",
    "curl",
    "-f",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/health"
  ],
  "Interval": 30000000000,
  "Timeout": 10000000000,
  "StartPeriod": 30000000000,
  "Retries": 3
}
```
5. Now in the `Update Config`

Now when the application is getting unhealthy response from the health check, the container will rollback to the previous version.

Paste the following code:
```json
{
  "Parallelism": 1,
  "Delay": 10000000000,
  "FailureAction": "rollback",
  "Order": "start-first"
}
```
