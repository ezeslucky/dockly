- **Personal Secret**: Select the secret that you want to connect to Dokploy.
- **Group Name(Optional)**: Select the group name that you want to connect to Dokploy(Ideal for Gitlab Groups).

Follow the steps to connect your Gitlab account to Dokploy.

2. Set Application Name: eg. `Dokploy-Gitlab-App`. choose any name that you want.

want to connect, and look at the URL in the address bar, it will be something like this

## Setup Automatic Deployments

You can configure automatic deployments in Dokploy for the Following Services:

1. **Applications**
2. **Docker Compose**

The steps are the same for both services.

1. Go to either `Applications` or `Docker Compose` and go to `Deployments` Tab.
2. Copy the `Webhook URL`.
3. Go to your Gitlab Account and select the repository.
4. In the left menu, select `Settings` and then `Webhooks`.
5. Click on `Add Webhook`.
6. Set the `URL` to the one you copied in the previous step.
7. In the Trigger section, select `Push Events`.
8. Click on `Add Webhook`.
9. Click on `Save`.
10. Now you have automatic deployments enabled for the selected repository.


## Clarification on Automatic Deployments

By default, Dokploy will automatically deploy your application on the Branch you have selected.

eg. Let's suppose you have a `application` in this way:

Repository: `my-app`
Branch: `feature`

If you try to make a push on another branch eg. `main`, Dokploy will not automatically deploy your application, because 
your application have selected `feature` as the Branch.

<Callout>
In the case you want to have multiple applications in the same repository, eg. (development, staging, production), you can create 3 `Applications` in Dokploy
and select the branch in each of them.

This is very usefull if you want to have multiple environments for the same application.
