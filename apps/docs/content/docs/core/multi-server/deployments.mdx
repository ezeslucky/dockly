To get started with multi-server, you'll need to configure the initial setup for your remote server.

## Server Setup

The server setup process prepares the necessary environment for securely and efficiently deploying applications.

<Callout title="Important" type="info">
  Root access to the server is required. We currently do not support non-root deployments.
</Callout>

We provide two main actions to configure your server:

- **Modify Script**: Allows you to view and customize the installation script that will be executed on your server. You can adjust it according to your specific needs.
- **Setup Server**: Initiates the configuration process on the remote server. When clicked, it will open a modal window showing real-time logs of the script execution.

Example of the server setup logs:
