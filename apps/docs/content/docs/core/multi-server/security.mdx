Dokploy provides comprehensive security recommendations to protect your remote server. Our security checks ensure your server follows best practices for a secure deployment environment.

## Security Recommendations

### Operating System
- Currently supports Ubuntu/Debian OS (Experimental)
- Regular system updates recommended

### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
UFW is an essential security component that manages incoming and outgoing network traffic.

**Recommended Configuration:**
- ✅ UFW should be installed
- ✅ UFW should be active
- ✅ Default incoming policy should be set to 'deny'
- ✅ Only necessary ports should be opened

### SSH Security
Secure Shell (SSH) configuration is crucial for safe remote server access.

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ SSH service should be enabled
- ✅ Key-based authentication should be enabled
- ❌ Password authentication should be disabled
- ❌ PAM should be disabled when using key-based authentication
- ✅ Use non-standard SSH port (optional)

### Fail2Ban Protection
Fail2Ban helps prevent brute force attacks by temporarily banning IPs that show malicious behavior.

**Recommended Setup:**
- ✅ Fail2Ban should be installed
- ✅ Service should be enabled and running
- ✅ SSH protection should be enabled
- ✅ Use aggressive mode for enhanced security
